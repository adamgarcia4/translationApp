# translationApp
This is a very quick and small application that I made to assist me in my Hebrew-learning journey.  

## Problem
Very frequently, I turn to Google Translate for translations of words.  However, the Google Translator attempts to translate logical portions of a sentence together, rather than a word-by-word translation.

## Solution
Provide a user-friendly interface to perform individual word transations behind the scenes.  The user can now simply enter any length of text and receive word-by-word translations.

## Technology Used

As this was designed to be a very quick project, I utilized technology that I am very familiar with.  The additional challenge that I placed upon myself for the purposes of learning was to not use any frontend framework (like Angular 2), and get familiar with making AJAX calls directly via Jquery.

- Backend
  - Node.js Programming Language
  - Express.js Web Application Framework
- Frontend
  - Jquery for Single Page Application functionality
  - Bootstrap CSS framework
