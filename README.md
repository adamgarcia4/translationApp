# translationApp
This is a very quick and small application that I made to assist me in my Hebrew-learning journey.  

## Problem
Very frequently, I turn to Google Translate for translations of words.  However, the Google Translator attempts to translate logical portions of a sentence together, rather than a word-by-word translation.

## Solution
Provide a user-friendly interface to perform individual word transations behind the scenes.  The user can now simply enter any length of text and receive word-by-word translations.
